# Roguelike

This project follows [/r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/)'s initiative of creating a tutorial series.
All tutorials can be found [here](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).
This repo is a fork of the original to be able to link to other users doing the same tutorial (See other forks of upstream).

## Usage

Roguelike uses [libtcod](https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod) and to ease usage, it is bundled with a mac compiled version, slightly tweaked to allow for relative paths.
It was compiled using the instructions provided by [/u/droidenko](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/44ylt4/python_libtcod_on_macosx/).

To run the game, just execute:
```bash
python rl.py
```
